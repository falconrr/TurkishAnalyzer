Turkish-LEX is composed of two python scripts.
1. The first script (WFreq.py) takes the data and process the text to generate a frequency profile
in the form of unigrams and bigrams. Graphics are produced as well. Finally, it generates a wordlist (wordlist.txt) for the second script.

 How to run in the command line:
$ python3 Wfreq.py data/TestFile.txt

2. The second script (FreqListToStimuliTurkish.py) compares the lexical frequency from the wordlist previously created with a corpus of the Turkish language.
This provides a way to determine lexical sophistication in the language. Frequency tables, global frequency averages, and plots are also generated. Results are stored by default in the results folder.

How to run in the command line:
$ cat results/wordlist.txt | python3 FreqListToStimuliTurkish.py
